This repository includes a simple notebook explaining how the model works by predicting the stimulated CD4 T cells from Kang et al. (2017). This example also shows how to generate intermediary cells between two condition for CD14-Mono cells from the same data set.


To run the notebook you need follwoing packages :
tensorflow, scanpy, numpy, matplotlib, scipy.
